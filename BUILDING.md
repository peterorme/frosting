# Building Frosting

First off: I have no frigging clue what I'm doing here. Shooting from the hip. Feedback is welcome. 


the intention is that you should be able to clone this and do 

	npm install

And then run any of 

* gulp clean
* gulp test
* gulp build
* gulp watch 

And at some point 
* gulp doc
